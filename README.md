## Project Overview

EcoPack AI is an AI-powered web application that provides instant, eco-friendly packaging recommendations for any product SKU. Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, it leverages modern UI components and a custom recommendation engine to help businesses and individuals choose sustainable packaging options.

### Key Features

- **AI-Driven Recommendations:**  
  Enter your product specifications (dimensions, weight, fragility, product type), and instantly receive tailored packaging suggestions optimized for sustainability, cost, and carbon footprint.

- **Supplier & Pricing Integration:**  
  Get real-time supplier information and estimated pricing for recommended packaging materials.

- **Eco & Cost Scoring:**  
  Each recommendation includes an eco score, cost score, and estimated carbon savings compared to conventional plastic packaging.

- **Downloadable Reports:**  
  Generate and download a detailed report of your recommendations for record-keeping or sharing.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  Responsive, accessible design with interactive feedback (toasts, modals, loading animations) for a seamless user experience.

- **Built for Hackathons & Real-World Use:**  
  Originally created for the Walmart Sparkathon 2025, but suitable for any organization seeking to improve packaging sustainability.

## How It Works

1. **Input Product Details:**  
   Users fill out a form with product dimensions, weight, fragility, and type.

2. **AI Recommendation Engine:**  
   The app sends these specs to an AI-powered backend (or mock API) that analyzes the data and returns the best sustainable packaging options.

3. **View & Compare Options:**  
   Recommendations are displayed with detailed descriptions, eco/cost scores, supplier links, and AI-generated analysis.

4. **Download or Share:**  
   Users can download a text report of the recommendations for further use.
